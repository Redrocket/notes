Not really ulimit issue, show threads per user:

    for USER in `ps -ef | egrep -v '^UID' | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort -u`; do echo -n "$USER: "; ps -u $USER -L | wc -l; done | sort -rn -k2 


Whats my SOFT ulimit allowed for ALL values?

     ulimit -Sa



How many processes have I running? 1 More than soft limit allowed.


     ulimit -Su
     1024
     ps -u stkilduf -L|wc -l
     1025
     while true; do sleep 1; ps -u stkilduf -L|wc -l; done


In another shell, create some process and watch the counter in the loop above change. Also see errors from when no more processes are allowed, because of process soft limit.

    for i in {1..1300}; do less & doneo
    [995] 11089
    [996] 11090
    -bash: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable
