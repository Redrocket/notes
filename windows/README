How to show mounted drives:

    C:\Users\person>net use
    New connections will be remembered.
    
    
    Status       Local     Remote                    Network
    
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OK                     \\remote.share.example.com\Users
                                                    Microsoft Windows Network
    The command completed successfully.


Mount a remote drive locally:

    net use x: \\remote.share.example.com\Sharename
