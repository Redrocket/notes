Random notes about postgres, probably will not make much sense to other people.


    ALTER ROLE davide WITH PASSWORD 'hu8jmn3';
    SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_shadow;


    SELECT pg_encoding_to_char(encoding) FROM pg_database WHERE datname = 'bacula';
    SHOW CLIENT_ENCODING;
    SHOW SERVER_ENCODING;


List databases and their encodings: 

    su postgres -c "psql -l -U postgres"
